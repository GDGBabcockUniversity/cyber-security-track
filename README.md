# Breaking into the Cybersecurity Industry: A Guide for Everyone.

The cybersecurity field is booming, with global spending projected to hit $170 billion in 2022. From 2018 to 2023, the market is expected to grow from $152.71 billion to $248.26 billion—a massive $95.5 billion jump in just three years. It’s one of the fastest-growing industries out there, and the demand for skilled professionals is higher than ever.

But with that demand comes the challenge of breaking in. The landscape is constantly changing, and figuring out where to start can feel overwhelming. That’s why I’m here to share my journey and offer a roadmap for anyone looking to land their first cybersecurity job.

## Starting from Scratch

When I made the leap from engineering to cybersecurity, I was swamped with anxiety, wondering where to even begin. Now, two years later, I’ve gone from struggling todecide if tech is for me to landing a job at a organization I love. The biggest lesson I’ve learned? Start with the basics.

This advice applies to anything in life, really. Whether you’re aiming for penetration testing, governance, risk and compliance, or incident response, you need a solid foundation in the fundamentals. Think of it like the basics in math, English, or economics—essential concepts that everyone needs to grasp.

### Understand the Fundamentals

The first step is to dive into the core principles of cybersecurity, like network security, cryptography, and cyber threats. Even if your degree isn’t in cybersecurity (and let’s be honest, not many Nigerian universities offer these courses), you can still get up to speed through online resources. MOOCs, YouTube tutorials, and bootcamps are all great ways to build a strong foundation.

I’m talking free online courses from top universities, Coursera, Udemy—you name it. I’ll drop some links at the end of this post to help you get started.

After I got a handle on the fundamentals, I felt like a professor, totally on top of the world. But here’s the deal: That alone isn’t going to land you a job. The big bucks come from skills and experience.

## Building a Strong Portfolio

Once you’ve got the basics down, it’s time to build up your skill set. This means getting hands-on with projects, participating in hackathons, and earning industry-recognized certifications. Some of the top certifications for entry-level roles include CompTIA A+, GIAC Penetration Tester, and Certified in Cybersecurity (CIC).

But remember, your skills should align with your goals. If you’re aiming to be a penetration tester, for instance, go for certifications that support that path. And don’t forget about soft skills—leadership, communication, problem-solving. These are crucial when it comes to working with teams and making informed decisions.

### Skills Are Everything!

Having a diverse set of skills makes you a much stronger candidate. And here’s a little secret: Networking is just as important. This was a struggle for me, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a game-changer.

## Networking with Industry Professionals

Networking can open doors to job opportunities, internships, and mentorships. Attend cybersecurity conferences, meetups, and online events to connect with professionals. Join LinkedIn, Facebook, and Discord groups focused on cybersecurity. Building a strong network can lead to valuable guidance and job leads.

One tip? Offer to buy a potential mentor a coffee or lunch so you can pick their brain. Small gestures can go a long way.

## Gaining Hands-on Experience

Now, let’s talk experience. One of the biggest questions I hear is, “How do I get a job that requires experience when I need a job to get experience?” In cybersecurity, this isn’t as much of a catch-22 as it seems.

Internships are a great way to gain experience. Look for roles in network administration, penetration testing, or incident response. These gigs give you hands-on experience and insight into the daily life of a cybersecurity pro.

If internships are hard to come by (especially in Nigeria), consider setting up home labs. There are tons of lab setups you can try at home to get familiar with the tools and techniques used by professionals. Tailor these labs to the role you’re aiming for, and you’ll build valuable experience that sets you apart.

## Staying Current with Trends and Technologies

Finally, remember that cybersecurity is always evolving. You’ve got to stay on top of the latest trends, tools, and technologies. Subscribe to cybersecurity publications, attend workshops, and keep learning through online courses.

Staying current ensures you’re always ready to tackle the next big challenge in this fast-paced field.

## Wrapping It Up

Breaking into cybersecurity isn’t easy, but with hard work, dedication, and the right approach, it’s definitely possible. Start with a solid foundation of knowledge, build a diverse skill set, network with professionals, gain hands-on experience, and stay up to date with the latest trends. Do this, and you’ll be well on your way to a successful career in cybersecurity.
