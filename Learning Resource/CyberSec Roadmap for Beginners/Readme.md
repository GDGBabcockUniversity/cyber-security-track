# Roadmap to Landing a Solid Cybersecurity Job

Breaking into the cybersecurity field can be challenging, especially when companies are hesitant to trust their security to someone without a proven track record. However, there’s a strategic way to build your skills and credentials that can help you land a solid cybersecurity gig. Here’s a roadmap to guide you:

## 1. Start with YouTube
Begin by watching in-depth videos or playlists about cybersecurity (and ethical hacking if that’s your interest). The longer and more detailed, the better. Don’t just watch—follow along with what you see on the screen. This approach helps you:

- Build hands-on experience and capability
- Conduct research and deepen your knowledge

The more content you absorb and practice, the stronger your foundational skills will become.

## 2. Explore Online Learning Platforms
Next, turn to platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Forage, etc. These platforms offer courses that can significantly enhance your learning. For instance, I started with **Cybersecurity for Absolute Beginners** by Zaid Sabih on Udemy. This course was pivotal in my journey, eventually helping me secure a position as the GDSC Cybersecurity Lead.

### Recommended Platforms:
- **Udemy**: Comprehensive courses with certificates of completion
- **Coursera**: Offers industry-recognized certifications (though some are paid)
- **Forage**: Provides free simulations that replicate real-world tasks

### A Note on Certificates:
While some courses are free, they might not offer a certificate. However, what truly matters at this stage is gaining experience. Paid courses typically come with certificates, which can bolster your credibility.

## 3. Build Your Portfolio
After completing a few courses, you should have at least 5 certificates of completion. These certificates serve as evidence of your hard work and can help you land remote jobs or small gigs with your peers. For example, you could offer to handle both Cybersecurity and Quality Assurance—this strategy has worked for me.

## 4. Keep Your LinkedIn Updated
As you progress, ensure your LinkedIn profile reflects your new skills and certifications. Recruiters often scout for talent on LinkedIn, especially when you’re still building experience. Regular updates can make a big difference in attracting their attention.

## Additional Tips:
- If you're considering the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Course** on Coursera, be aware that it costs $49/month after the one-week free trial. While it's a recognized certification, you might prefer free alternatives if budget is a concern.
- Personally, I completed the Google certification in just 5 days by speed running it to get the certificate. However, I recommend taking your time with other courses to genuinely build your skills.

## Final Thoughts
Experience trumps certificates in the long run, so focus on learning and applying what you know. With dedication and the right resources, you’ll be well on your way to landing a solid cybersecurity job.

Good luck on your journey!
