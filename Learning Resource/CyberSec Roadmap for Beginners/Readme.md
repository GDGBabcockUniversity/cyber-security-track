# How to Land a Solid Cybersecurity Gig (or yk, something that wont let hunger kill youðŸ˜‚)

Breaking into cybersecurity isnâ€™t easy, especially when companies are reluctant to trust their security to someone without a proven track record. But donâ€™t worryâ€”thereâ€™s a way around it. Hereâ€™s a roadmap that can help you build your skills and land that cybersecurity job:

## 1. Start with YouTube
Kick things off by diving into some long YouTube videos or playlists about cybersecurity (or ethical hacking if thatâ€™s your thing). The key here is to watch as much as you can and follow along with whatâ€™s on the screen.

- **Why?** It helps you gain hands-on experience and build your skills.
- **Bonus:** Youâ€™ll get better at researching and learning on your own.

The more you watch and do, the more confident youâ€™ll become.

## 2. Check Out Online Learning Platforms
Next, head over to sites like Udemy, Coursera, Forage, etc. They offer courses that can really boost your learning. For example, my dad bought me a Udemy course called **Cybersecurity for Absolute Beginners** by Zaid Sabih, and it was a game-changer for me. It even helped me land a spot as the GDSC Cybersecurity Lead.

### Some Platforms to Explore:
- **Udemy**: Tons of courses, most with certificates.
- **Coursera**: Recognized certifications (some are paid).
- **Forage**: Free, real-world simulations.

### Certificates Matter (But Not Always):
Some courses are free but donâ€™t offer certificates. Thatâ€™s okayâ€”experience is what counts at this stage. If you can swing it, paid courses almost always come with a certificate.

## 3. Build Up Your Portfolio
After completing a few courses, you should have around 5 certificates of completion. These can help you get remote gigs or part-time work, maybe even with friends. For instance, try pitching yourself as a Cybersecurity and Quality Assurance comboâ€”itâ€™s worked for me!

## 4. Keep Your LinkedIn Updated
As youâ€™re learning and earning those certificates, make sure your LinkedIn profile is up to date. Recruiters love to see progress, especially when youâ€™re just starting out. A polished LinkedIn profile can really help you stand out.

## A Couple of Extra Tips:
- If youâ€™re thinking about the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Course** on Coursera, just know itâ€™s $49/month after the free week. If thatâ€™s too much, look for free alternatives.
- Full disclosure: I sped through the Google cert in 5 days just to get the paper. Not my proudest moment, but hey, itâ€™s a certificate! Still, I recommend taking your time with other courses to really learn.

## Wrap-Up
At the end of the day, experience is what will get you the job. Focus on learning, applying your skills, and keep hustling. Youâ€™ve got this!

Good luck out there!
Much love and Whatever, Tolu Issa Oderinde (GDSC CyberSec Lead '23/'24)
